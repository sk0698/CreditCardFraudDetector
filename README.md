# CreditCardFraudDetector
This repository explores various predictive models to accurately detect fraudulent transactions within a financial dataset. The dataset, while anonymized for privacy, provides a rich basis for understanding transaction behavior and the effectiveness of different classification algorithms.

#Conclusion
Implementing SMOTE on our imbalanced dataset helped us with the imbalance of our labels (more no fraud than fraud transactions). Nevertheless, I still have to state that sometimes the neural network on the oversampled dataset predicts less correct fraud transactions than our model using the undersample dataset. However, remember that the removal of outliers was implemented only on the random undersample dataset and not on the oversampled one. Also, in our undersample data our model is unable to detect for a large number of cases non fraud transactions correctly and instead, misclassifies those non fraud transactions as fraud cases. Imagine that people that were making regular purchases got their card blocked due to the reason that our model classified that transaction as a fraud transaction, this will be a huge disadvantage for the financial institution. The number of customer complaints and customer disatisfaction will increase. The next step of this analysis will be to do an outlier removal on our oversample dataset and see if our accuracy in the test set improves.
